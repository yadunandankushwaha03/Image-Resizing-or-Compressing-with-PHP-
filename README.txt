There are two files you need for this system namely "index.php" and "configuration.php" found in the downloaded zipped file

To use the system, simply open the "configuration.php" file and set your desired width, height, location-of-the-files-you-want-to-resize and upload the "index.php" and the "configuration.php" files to your server then view the "index.php" file via your web browser to see the total number of files that will be resized and put back into their respective locations.

If you need to upload these two files to your server root directory where you have an exsiting "index.php" file then you need to rename the "index.php" file for this system to some other name before uploading these two files to your server to avoid overwriting your existing index.php file.


If you upload these two files to your server root directory and the directory where the image(s) you want to resize is also located in your root directory, lets assume the name of the directory containing the image file(s) is called "images", just specify this directory name in the "configuration.php" file and you are good to go.

Thank you,
